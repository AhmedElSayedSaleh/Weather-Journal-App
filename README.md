# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, installed in your environement.

### Node
- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.

  - #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

### Start the express server
To start the express server, run the following

`node server.js`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and take a look around.



## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.
